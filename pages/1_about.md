A major motivation of this project is to explore Protective Decision Making.  One question being asked is: 

> What can we learn about the protective decisions a person makes regarding their physical location from his or her geo-located Twitter activity?

With such a large amount of data, however, it is impossible to perform qualitative analysis on all Twitterers that were active during Hurricane Sandy.  The goal of this project, then, is to develop a method of quantitative and geo-spatial analysis to identify users that may have been ordered to evacuate during Hurricane Sandy.

Below is a map showing users with a base tweeting location inside of a New York City Evacuation Zone A, presumably most or all were ordered to evacuate on Sunday, October 28, 2012.

The first form of this project was a Geography Project for GEOG 5303 with Professor Stefen Leyk at CU.  The data aggregation and continuation of the research is done by [Project EPIC](http://epic.cs.colorado.edu). Original project collaborators include Andrew Hardin and Ellie Falletta from CU Geography.

There are two associated GitHub repositories with this project:

 - This project: [Twitter Evacuation Patterns](https://github.com/jenningsanderson/Twitter-Evacuation-Patterns)
 - Previous Project (Deprecated): [GIS 3 Hurricane Sandy Project](https://github.com/jenningsanderson/GIS3-Sandy-Project)
