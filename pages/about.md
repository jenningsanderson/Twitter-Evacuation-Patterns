This project was originally designed as a Geography Project for GEOG 5303 with Professor Stefen Leyk at CU.  The data aggregation and continuation of the research is done by [Project EPIC](http://epic.cs.colorado.edu). Project collaborators include Andrew Hardin and Ellie Falletta from CU Geography.
