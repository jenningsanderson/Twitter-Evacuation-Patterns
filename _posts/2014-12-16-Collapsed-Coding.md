Here is a proposed new collapsed coding scheme based on hierarchical collapsing of the [previous coding scheme]({{site.baseurl}}/coding)

###Coding Scheme
	
| Personal Sentiment    |  Preparation | Movement  | Reporting on Environment  | Collective Orientation | 
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lighter-Hearted       | Power        | Move Away | Weather                   | Pass On Information    |
| Angry/Dark/Dismissive | Supplies     | Move Back | Immediate Personal Environment | Seek Information  |
| Anxious/Frustrated    | Physical     | Stationary| Other Built Environment   | What Others are Doing  |
| Prepared/Settled      | Transport    |           |                           |                        |
| Bored                 | Booze        |           |                           |                        |
|                       | Plans        |           |                           |                        |

##Coding Scheme Explained

| Sentiment | |
|:----------|----------------------------| 
| Lighter-Hearted | Light-hearted comedy about the storm, not dark humor |
| Angry/Dark/Dismissive | Angry, Defiant, dark humor, negative sarcasm   |
| Anxious/Frustrated    | Worried, anxious, frustrated at not knowing information on their hometown, etc |
| Prepared/Settled      | Feeling ready for the storm
| Bored                 | Stuck at home, nothing to do, typically seen as "I'm sooooo bored" |


| Preparation | |
|:----------|----------------------------| 
| Power                 | Mentions of Generators, charging phones, laptops, etc |
| Supplies              | Stocking up on general supplies: food, water, other supplies, rationing things   |
| Physical              | Preparing the physical environment: boarding up windows, sandbags, etc |
| Transport             | Preparing vehicles or purchasing tickets |
| Booze                 | Any mention of alcohol or drugs -- very prevalent, making own category to reduce noise |
| Plans                 | Discussion of changing or maintaining existing plans |

| Movement | |
|:----------|----------------------------| 
| Move Away | Leaves, Evacuates, Example: "And with that we evacuate to higher ground" |
| Move Back | Comes home  |
| Stationary| Discussion of Hunkering or not moving |

| Reporting on Environment | |
|:----------|----------------------------| 
| Weather | Reporting on the current weather, surf, etc. |
| Personal | Reporting on immediate personal environment: "We still have power"  |
| Built Environment | Reporting on the built environment: "I just saw that Hoboken is underwater" |

| Collective Orientation | |
|:----------|----------------------------| 
| Pass On Information | Passing on information or answering questions, **not retweets** |
| Seeking Information | Asking questions related to the storm  |
| What Others Are Doing| Either doing what others are doing or discussing what others are doing: "I'm at this bar with 300 other people waiting out the storm", "I here there are tons of people at Moe's Tavern buying hurricane shots" |
