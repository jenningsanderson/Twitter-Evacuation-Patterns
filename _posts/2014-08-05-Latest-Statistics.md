#Current Summary Statistics

####Triangle Perimeter Graph
Identifying a natural break in perimeter length could determine a decent threshold between shelter-in-place and some type of movement.

####Isoceles Ratio vs. Triangle Perimeters
Looking at all users which either intersected with or had their before shelter location within the bounding box.

Looking much closer (not log scale on y-axis anymore), we see there is definately a break around 800 meters or so in the perimeters, implying a decent threshold value here.  More interestingly, there is a lot of clustering around an isoceles ratio of 1, implying that a lot of people return to from where they left.

Triangles!


How does this compare for evacuators, etc?
