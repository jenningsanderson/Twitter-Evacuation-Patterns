A new approach should be considered to create more flexible time bins per user.

The goal is to get better clusters by not separating out the times and then finding clusters which have a large temporal hole in them.


Now... How to do that.



###GeoSpatial Clustering






####Issues with Previous Method

 1. Users were far too dynamic in their time bins. Static time bins could not capture it.
 2. Evacuations are not as clear cut as originally hoped.  Some users did not return home immediately, this is probably  the result of the power outages along the Eastern Seaboard.
