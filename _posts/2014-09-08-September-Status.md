###Update for Project EPIC: September 08, 2014

_Protective Decision Making_: Shelter in place or evacuate?

1. Determining which users faced a decision: (Evacuate or Shelter-In-Place): [New Coastline Study Area]({{site.baseurl}}/data)

2. No longer using the triangle method because a user's movement path should not be separated into the original time bins.
	
3. New Design: [Gather all of a user's clusters]({{site.baseurl}}/Design)
	
4. Look at a user's path between clusters:

User: iKhoiBui
Before and during cluster:

Tweets during this time period:

###What we're currently doing
1. Which users are we specifically interested in?  Precision vs. Recall.  The method is far from perfect, but that's not the goal, we're looking to cast a wide net and see who may have been forced to make a protective decision during the event.

2. Qualitative Coding: [Coding Scheme]({{site.baseurl}}/coding)
