Twitter Evacuation Patterns
===========================


##Current Problems
1. Timeline Visualization is unclear as-is.
	- What is next? Even if we can make pattern from noise, what does it mean?


##Current Successes
1. Frequency Graphs tell a better story
2. Coding Scheme is collapsed


##Todo by Dec. 18
1. Line up all frequency graphs to see this story
2. Redo the timeline with better icons & resolution (in visjs)




##Next Steps
1. Identify new people from new study areas to code, focused NYC study areas:
	- Manhattan Evacuation Zones
	- Rockaway Beach
	- Staten Island
