#DB Scan

The previous k-means clustering algorithm failed at best identifying the dense clusters.  Two possible reasons for this are:
1. Needing to implicitly specify _k_
2. Setting a maximum number of iterations for the algorithm to run.

Regardless, DBScan is much better suited for this process.

#Reliability in relation to Time?
With new density calculations for the clusters, should the reliability of time over a series of days still be a concern?
